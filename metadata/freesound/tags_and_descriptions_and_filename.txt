The area was created in 1766 and first functioned in 1769. The area's function was to collect the water from the Meuse in times of flooding.This area consists of forest, farmland and the Nieuwe Wiel (or Lange Wiel), a small and deep water which was created in the 18th century when a dike burst.

It's slow and makes me think of something kicking into your system. Like poison for instance.

The Baardwijkse Overlaat (overlaat = a river flood area), were I have made this recording, is a nature reserve between the village Drunen and Waalwijk and has been managed by the Vereniging Natuurmonumenten (national nature care) since 1978. The area was created in 1766 and first functioned in 1769. The area's function was to collect the water from the Meuse in times of flooding.This area consists of forest, farmland and the Nieuwe Wiel (or Lange Wiel), a small and deep water which was created in the 18th century when a dike burst.

A car starts, birds sing louder and a quiet bell announcing the angelus.Sound of metal blind again then a bell rings 3 strikes 3 times and starts Angelus. This sequence was recorded during the COVID lockdown, which explains this abnormally calm atmosphere on the port and in town.This is a long take.

The mic was placed about two inches away, perpendicular to the face of the clock with the dial window open. The only processing I applied was a FabFilter ProQ3 48dB/oct low cut at 110Hz to eliminate of some of the room/ac rumble.

    description is: The coot (also black coot, scientific name Fulica atra) is a water bird of the family Rallidae. It is widespread in Europe, Asia, Australia and parts of AfricaFamily: RallidaeOrder: cranes (Gruiformes)Class: Birds (Aves)Size: 36-42 cmPrevalence: common in places, otherwise rareHabitat: larger bodies of water, gravel or puddles, in winter also by riversEndangered species: not endangeredConservation status of a species: potentially endangered speciesRecognitionGeneral: The waterfowl is a constant bird that gathers in large flocks in winter and can also migrate shorter distances, especially along larger rivers or lakes. Otherwise, it is a territorial bird. Very recognizable, sociable and quite fearless. She swims jerkily with a twitch of her neck, frightened, flies just above the surface of the water or even runs along it, and retreats into the middle of the water, which is very unusual for toucals, which are otherwise very timid. It feeds on aquatic plants, small insects, young fish, snails and spawning frogs, sinking only with its head. Adults: male and female are similar. The feathers are velvety to dirty black. Beak and frontal crest snow white. The eyes are tiny, red. The legs are gray to gray-green, the toes are wide swimming cloths. Nesting and spawning: nests sometime in March and June, the nest is hidden in riparian vegetation, often in reeds. The female lays 5 to 10 gray, spotted eggs and usually has 2 broods per year. Puppies are cared for by both parents. The cubs are runaways, black, naked on the head or. covered with reddish, bristly feathers. Young specimens are grayish brown, with more whiteness along the throat and neck.<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_01.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Sestrško jezero - snemanje ptic 01" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_01.jpg/512px-Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_01.jpg"></a><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_02.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Sestrško jezero - snemanje ptic 02" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_02.jpg/512px-Sestr%C5%A1ko_jezero_-_snemanje_ptic_02.jpg"></a>Recorder: ZOOM H5 + MSH-6If any of these sounds have been of help, and you are feeling charitable, please do consider <a href="https://freesound.org/donations/donate/" rel="nofollow">donating to Freesound.org</a> to help keep the site running (a link is also on the home page).

    description is: Sample of a metallic percussion hit. The sound is quite dark and muffled. I call it Underwater Drum, because it sounds to me like it's underwater.This sample is tuned to E1 but there is a very dominant overtone at F#1, which is the musical interval of a minor second.The source of the sample was the platter of a dismantled hard disk drive, hit with a wooden mallet. It was then pitched down a lot. The sample is almost raw, I just added some slight EQ.The sample was intended to be used with a sampler, you may want to add some reverb for this and filter the previously mentioned overtone, when you use it in combination with other tuned instruments. Also, the pitch is probably not perfectly tuned.Microphone: AKQ Perception 120Post-Processing: Pitch Manipulation &amp; EQ

    tags are: guitar,sample,single-notes,instrument,plucked,string,one-shot,
    description is: This is a single guitar string plucked with a pick directly at the headstock, that means between the tuners and the nut. There the string is very short and tight, resulting in a high, almost piano-like tone. Also, since there is no sound box, the tone is rather quiet.I used this for a sampler and I liked the sound of it. This is the raw recording. If you want to use it in a sampler too, I recommend adding some EQ, Reverb and maybe some delay. It is not perfectly in tune though, the closest note is A#. You might tweak the tuning a little bit when using it in combination with other tuned instruments.Microphone: AKG Perception 120Post-Processing: None

    description is: Clean recording of various sounds that would occur when maneuvering around an office space (specifically a desk) and manipulating common office objects. Recording features lots of paper rustling and sliding across a wooden desk, handling pens and a stapler, stuffing manila folders and plastic binders, and towards the end there are some sounds of small-medium sized personal bag being unzipped and zipped and then being filled with some of the office materials. Should work great for filling in general office noises in a scene or reinforcing actions that involve any of the materials featured in the recording. There should be enough variety to allow you to glean more isolated sounds or just use assortments of layered sounds.Recorded with an AKG P170 into a TASCAM 208i audio interface at 48kHz/24-bit. Microphone was positioned roughly 1.5 - 2 feet away from the source. There is some slight room reverb present, which is intentional, and should match common office workspaces well. An 85Hz high-pass filter was applied to remove any unintentional, unnatural low-frequency rumbling that may have been picked up during recording.

    description is: Clean, dry recording of a smartphone touchscreen being rapidly tapped as if a message was being written on it. Could just as easily be used as sounds from using (writing, playing mobile games, browsing, etc) a tablet or really any relatively small touchscreen device. Tapping speed and length between taps varies throughout the recording, but overall I tried to make it sound as natural as possible while still offering options for more granular placement.Recorded with an AKG P170 into a TASCAM 208i audio interface at 48kHz/24-bit. Microphone was positioned 5-6 inches away from source. A 120Hz high-pass filter was applied to remove unnecessarily pronounced bass frequencies.
